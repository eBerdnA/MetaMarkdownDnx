Basically this is just a version of [MetaMarkdown](https://github.com/bradwestness/MetadataMarkdownSharp) and [Markdown](https://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/) which did not exist so far for DNX / ASP.NET 5 or I simply did not find. As I needed this to play around with some stuff I simply deceided to throw this together so that I can use it.

Usage is the same as with original MetaMarkdown. Only the tests from MetaMarkdown have been implemented but not the test for Markdown itself which I think would be useless because I simply took the complete source and changed only the initialisation of the settings.

Hopefully someone else has a usage for this.
